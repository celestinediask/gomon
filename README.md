# gomon
compile daemon for golang

To install
```
sudo cp -i gomon.sh /usr/local/bin/gomon
```
Warning!!! Currently this is only tested in debian.

I searched for compile daemon which works like nodemon and found one but when running backend frameworks theres no color in the output. So I made one from scratch. Basicaly this will restart server when changes were made in the current directory.
